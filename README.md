# Codewars && Euler project && Technical exercises interviews

## A place to upload some exercises from the Codewars platform, Euler project, and also some coding exercises and questions from technical interviews during a job-hunting season

**1 Expandit** | Technical interview |  Write a function that receives a string and return true if the pharentesis are
balanced, in case parentheses are not balanced it should return the index that breaks the balance.

**2 Number of Decimal Digits** | Codewars | Determine the total number of digits in the integer (n>=0) given as input to the function.

**3 Move zeros to end** | Codewars | Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

**4 Array to sum** | Technical interview | Create a function that can add up every element in the array that can be parsed to a number.

**5 FizzBuzz** | Technical interview | Show a list that counts from 1 to 50 and based on the number of item print:

    - Fizz if it's a multiple of 3,
    - Buzz if it's a multiple of 5, and
    - if multiple of both write FizzBuzz.

**6 Breaking Chocolate problem** | Codewars & Technical interview | Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

**7 Mumbling** | Codewars & Technical interview | This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

    Examples:
    - accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
    - accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
    - accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"

The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

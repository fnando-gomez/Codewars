# Codewars & Euler project

## A place to upload some exercises from the Codewars platform & also some coding exercises and questions from technical interviews during a job-hunting season

**1 Expandit** | Technical interview |  Write a function that receives a string and return true if the pharentesis are
balanced, in case parentheses are not balanced it should return the index that breaks the balance.

**2 Number of Decimal Digits** | Codewars | Determine the total number of digits in the integer (n>=0) given as input to the function.

**3 Move zeros to end** | Codewars | Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

**4 Array to sum** | Technical interview | Create a function that can add up every element in the array that can be parsed to a number.

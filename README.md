# Codewars && Euler project && Technical exercises interviews

## A place to upload some exercises from the Codewars platform, Euler project, coding exercises, and questions from technical interviews during the job-hunting season. 

**1 Expandit** | Technical interview |  Write a function that receives a string and return true if the pharentesis are
balanced, in case parentheses are not balanced it should return the index that breaks the balance.

**2 Number of Decimal Digits** | Codewars | Determine the total number of digits in the integer (n>=0) given as input to the function.

**3 Move zeros to end** | Codewars | Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

**4 Array to sum** | Technical interview | Create a function that can add up every element in the array that can be parsed to a number.

**5 FizzBuzz** | Technical interview | Show a list that counts from 1 to 50 and based on the number of item print:

    - Fizz if it's a multiple of 3,
    - Buzz if it's a multiple of 5, and
    - if multiple of both write FizzBuzz.

**5.1 FizzBuzz** | Technical interview (the new conditions were shared in a coding-group as a new approach to the problem) | Same exercise, but with the next conditions:
    - You can use only one "if"
    - You can't use "else", "else if", "case" or a terniary operator

**6 Breaking Chocolate problem** | Codewars & Technical interview | Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

**7 Mumbling** | Codewars & Technical interview | This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

    Examples:
    - accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
    - accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
    - accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"

The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

**8 Fibonacci** | From [The Coding Interview](https://www.thecodinginterview.com) | Coding interview question from Netflix. This question is often asked by Netflix in junior & intermediate coding interviews:

Write a function *fib()* that takes an integer *n* and returns the *nth* Fibonacci number.

Note: The Fibonacci series is a numerical series where each item is the sum of the two previous items. It starts off like this: *0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...*

**9 Sum of multiples 3 & 5** | [Euler project](https://projecteuler.net/) - Problem 1 | Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

**10 Even Fibonacci numbers** | [Euler project](https://projecteuler.net/) - Problem 2 | By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**11 Reverse words** | Technical interviews | Your task is to reverse the order or words in each line of input, while preserving the words themselves.
